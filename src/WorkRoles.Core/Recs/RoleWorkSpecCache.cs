    /// - Owner: the caller-supplied owner token; an owner change drops every
    ///   previous entry (no identity crosses stores).
    /// - Key: stable role id within the current stamp.
    /// - Value: one immutable RoleWorkSpec per role.
    /// - Dependencies: the revision and the index identity; either change
    ///   invalidates the whole generation.
    /// - Refresh: immediate on the first read after a stamp change.
    /// - Equality: an equal rebuild republishes the previous instance
    ///   (RoleWorkSpec.StructurallyEqual).
    /// - Teardown: Reset clears entries and identity seeds; idempotent.
